# Blender-Object-Name-Helper
Little Helper for Object / Mesh name management
o Install go to Edit/Preferences/Add Ons and select object_name_helper.py file New menu will be visible when in Object Mode under 3D View called Object Tools

There are three options atm
# Match mesh names
o Clicking will match every mesh name inside the object to name of the object
# Default Names Check
o Click to see if you have any default object or mesh names in current scene i.e Cube, Sphere etc. This will not take into account Cameras and Lights. After clicking you will see little panel with the information.
# Rename Partially
You can rename part of the object i.e your object name is "Cup_LOD1" you can specify From "Cup" and To "Coffee", your object name become "Coffe_LOD1"
The option works with multiple object. Change will be applied only to the selected object, so make sure to select objects before.
